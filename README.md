Conventure Take Home

This take home is for Conventure. Note: I don't have any experience or background in Finance. However, I did the best I can to learn the the concepts of finance to do this take home and try really hard to focus on the programming aspect of the take home. 


Part 1:
1) Go to Yahoo Finance and download a csv file of daily historical data on AAPL from Jan 1, 2002-Jan 1, 2010.

- [AAPL.csv](https://github.com/bvi1994/CoventureTakeHome/blob/master/AAPL.csv)

2) Build a moving average strategy that tests a 5-day and 20-day moving average crossover.  The strategy should go long when the 5-day moving average crosses above the 20-day moving average and short when the 5-day moving average crosses below the 20-day moving average.
3) Build another strategy that buys AAPL when it closes down 3 days in a row and then sells the stock 1, 5, and 10 days later.  

Part 2: 
4) Graph the equity curve of the strategies
5) List each trade in the strategy
6) What 3 metrics would you analyse to determine whether the strategy was good or bad (not including the overall PNL of the strategy)?
7) How would you allocate capital between the two strategies? 

Part 3 (Bonus): 
8) If you complete this, find another data source to leverage as an overlay, explain why you used it and how you got it. 
9) How did this improve the system? What metrics do you look at?
